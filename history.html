   <p><strong>This website has been created by Joe Smith and provides an overview of three of the four cars parked in Joe’s driveway right now. Joe grew up in Illinois and loves German cars, in particular Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes-Benz was started in 1884 and are the “inventors” of the automobile. Yes Mercedes-Benz started it all, and the rest of the world has been following ever since. Mercedes-Benz has been the inventors of many of the safety and technological advances which are found commonly in most cars today, including Monocoque design, - where the car body and chassis are not built separately but together - Airbags and ABS brakes</strong></p>
